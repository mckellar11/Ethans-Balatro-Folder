# Balatro Goes Kino

By Ice/IcyEthics

Requirements:

- Talisman

Balatro Goes Kino is a mod made to turn a game for poker nerds into a game for poker and movie nerds. It's main content is a large set of jokers inspired by movies, as well as new Enhancements and Tarot cards, with plans for boss blinds, challenges and decks.

### Current Content
- **60+ New Jokers**:  From hits like Titanic, E.T. and Iron Man to unnotable and unremarkable flops like The Three Musketeers (2011) and Krazy House. With many more jokers planned.
- **2 Enhancement:** Introducing Sci-fi and Demonic Cards! 
- **3 Genre boosters:** New joker boosters, containing only jokers of the given genre.

### Planned Content

- *Confections.*
Snacks, they're a key part of going to the movies.

- *A lot of additional jokers.*
On streaming soon: Singing in the Rain, Jaws, and Chef.

- *A bunch of new Enhancements.*
Horror cards, Fantasy cards, Mystery cards and Romance cards, all coming up.

- *More boosters.*
Probably should get the other big genres in there, huh?

- *Real dumb film nerd mechanics.*
Get ready for jokers to get bonuses when they all share an actor, or the Kevin Bacon sticker, debuffing jokers if you don't own another joker that shares them.

- *Genre & Director decks.*
Increase the chances of associated jokers showing up, and start with a joker of that genre, or by that director.

### FAQ:
*Is this mod balanced?*
Not yet, at least. I've not focused on balancing yet at all. Feedback on balancing is encouraged and welcomed!

*Why are most jokers Common?*
I haven't figured out yet which ones deserve which rarity, it's that simple. But they'll all get their proper rarity.
